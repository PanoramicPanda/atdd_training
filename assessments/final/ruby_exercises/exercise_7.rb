# Write a method that verifies the sort order of the following contract statuses
# The correct sort order is all Active contracts then Restricted contracts followed by Inactive contracts
#
# tips: The method can just return a simple true/false value
#
# expected output:
#  true
#  false
#  true
#  false


contracts_1 = %w(Active Restricted Restricted Inactive Inactive Inactive)
contracts_2 = %w(Active Restricted Active Inactive)
contracts_3 = %w(Active Inactive)
contracts_4 = %w(Active Active Active Restricted Inactive Restricted Inactive )

#Method goes here


# method call goes here
