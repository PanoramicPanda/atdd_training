2. Do the tests pass?
3. Do the tests implemented in the classroom still work?
4. Did you use the correct file structure specified for Cucumber?
5. Did you use proper Ruby naming conventions?
6. Do your tests have assertions?
7. Did you use good variable naming (i.e. avoid use of single letter variables)
